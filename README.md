## About

Hussein Salim is a writer whose work explores silence, grief, identity, and the unseen structures that shape inner life. His writing is marked by restraint, psychological precision, and a deep respect for stillness—not as absence, but as a place where meaning consolidates.

Drawing from a life shaped by transition and reinvention, Hussein writes for readers navigating loss, uncertainty, and the search for grounded belonging in an accelerated world.

Based in Kenya.

## Books

### The Silence That Changed Everything

**Status:** In Submission  
**Genre:** Literary Fiction

A profound meditation on descent, grief, and the ground beneath us. Following a man’s journey from altitude to earth—from the controlled silence of an airplane cabin to the silence of loss—this work explores what happens when external structures collapse and only stillness remains.

### The Stillness Between Us

**Status:** Published  
**Genre:** Literary Fiction (Novella)  
**Available:** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHJY0QLB)

A quiet exploration of intimacy, misunderstanding, and the cost of using stillness as both refuge and wall. When two people meet whose peace mirrors their own composure, both discover that what looks like harmony from the outside may be incompatible at the core.

### The Phoenix Covenant

**Status:** Published  
**Genre:** Literary Fiction (Novella)  
**Available:** [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G52BLBZG)

A metaphysical journey through collapse and reconstruction. When a man loses everything—his mother, his career, his identity—he is forced to confront what remains when all external scaffolding falls away. A story about spiritual audits, transformation, and the fire that reveals what cannot be destroyed.
